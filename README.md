# Task Tracker Application

A simple task tracker app built using React and json server.

This project focuses on using React and Asynchronous JS to create a task tracker that uses http requests to store, get, delete, or update data.

json server is used to simulate a database, this is where the tasks are stored.

React Router was used to render components more efficiently. I also used hooks like: useParams, Navigate, and useNavigate to add more dynamic capabilites in fetching individual task details.
